Getting Unread Gmail as an Atom Feed in VB.NET

Gmail currently provides a list of unread emails in a subscriber's inbox as an Atom feed. While that may change in the future, the following Alintex Script code will retrieve and print the returned XML given a username and password.

Update: see also |this post| which shows how to display the xml as html in your browser, and also provides a C# version of gmail.vb

Run the script as follows:

    ax[w]script [username] [password] gmail.vb

Paste the following into a file named gmail.vb and run it as shown in the line above.

    ' gmail.vb - gets unread gmail as an atom feed
    ' for Alintex Script - www.alintex.com
    ' usage: ax(w)script [username] [password] gmail.vb

    imports System
    imports System.Net
    imports System.IO
    imports System.Text

    #region "Script"

    ' check commandline arguments
    if (args.Length < 2)
       print("gmail.vb - gets unread gmail as an atom feed")
       print("Usage: ax(w)script [username] [password] gmail.vb")
       return
    end if

    ' connect to gmail and retrieve the atom xml feed
    client = new WebClient
    bytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(args(0) & ":" & args(1))
    client.Headers.Add("Authorization", "Basic " & _
       Convert.ToBase64String(bytes))

    gmailUri = "https://gmail.google.com/gmail/feed/atom"
    dim feedStream as Stream = client.OpenRead(gmailUri)
    reader = new StreamReader(feedStream)
    feedAsXml = reader.ReadToEnd()
    feedStream.Close()

    print(feedAsXml)

    #end region

Note:

    the code above doesn't need to handle exceptions as the script shell does it for you by default.
    the password is not transmitted in plaintext.
    if your username includes a '.' character, Alintex Script will think your specifying a file on the commandline. In that case use the /a[rgument] switch instead i.e. /a:my.name,password.
